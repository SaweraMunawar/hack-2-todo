# Constitution: Todo App Evolution - Hackathon II

## Project Identity
This is a spec-driven development project for the "Evolution of Todo" hackathon, transforming a simple console app into a cloud-native AI-powered distributed system. The project embodies AI-native, spec-driven development principles using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

## Core Principles

### 1. AI-First Development
All implementation must be generated by Claude Code from specifications. Human developers write specs; AI generates code.

### 2. Progressive Evolution
Build incrementally through 5 distinct phases:
- Phase I: Console App (In-Memory)
- Phase II: Web App (Flask/React)
- Phase III: AI Chatbot (MCP Tools)
- Phase IV: Kubernetes Deployment
- Phase V: Cloud-Native Architecture

### 3. Spec-Driven Rigor
Every feature requires written specifications before implementation. No code without specs.

### 4. Cloud-Native Architecture
Design for production-grade deployment with event-driven patterns and modern infrastructure.

### 5. Reusable Intelligence
Create agent skills and patterns that can be reused across phases.

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

### Development Process
- NO manual coding - all code generated by Claude Code from specifications
- MUST use GitHub Spec-Kit Plus for specification management
- MUST follow the 5-phase structure exactly as specified
- MUST implement all Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced features progressively

### Technology Stack
- **Phase I**: Python 3.13+, UV package manager
- **Phase II**: Flask, React, SQLite
- **Phase III**: MCP Tools, LangChain
- **Phase IV**: Kubernetes, Minikube
- **Phase V**: DigitalOcean, Event-Driven Architecture

### Code Quality
- Clean, maintainable code following Python/JavaScript best practices
- Proper error handling and user-friendly interfaces
- Type hints and documentation
- Security-conscious implementation

## Success Criteria

### Phase I Completion
- [ ] Working console application with 5 CRUD features
- [ ] All specifications documented in /specs
- [ ] Passes all acceptance criteria
- [ ] 90-second demonstration video

### Overall Project
- [ ] Complete all 5 phases with functional implementations
- [ ] Deploy to local Minikube and cloud Kubernetes
- [ ] Implement AI chatbot with MCP tools
- [ ] Create reusable Claude Code Agent Skills
- [ ] Document the spec-driven development process

## Quality Standards

### Code
- PEP 8 compliant Python
- Type hints on all functions
- Docstrings for public methods
- No hardcoded values

### User Experience
- Clear, intuitive interfaces
- Helpful error messages
- Consistent formatting
- Graceful error handling

### Security
- Input validation
- No sensitive data exposure
- Secure authentication (later phases)

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-01-XX | Use UV over pip/poetry | Modern, fast, single-tool solution |
| 2024-01-XX | In-memory for Phase I | Simplify initial implementation |
| 2024-01-XX | Dataclass for Task model | Clean, type-safe, modern Python |

## Phase I Specific Rules

1. **No Persistence**: Data lives only in memory
2. **No External Dependencies**: Standard library only
3. **Simple UI**: Console-based, menu-driven
4. **Five Features Only**: Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete
5. **Validation First**: All inputs must be validated
